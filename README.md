## Data Science Machine Learning Specialization Path

I am currently learning Data Science and Machine Learning at Codecademy. I am following the Data Science Machine Learning Specialization Path. Here, I will be documenting my progress.

### Learning Timeline

#### 12 February 2024

##### Design Database with PostgreSQL (Skill Path) at Codecademy

###### Completed
- Import and review the dataset Off-Platform Project : The Best of Baseball Awards to my local PostgreSQL database
